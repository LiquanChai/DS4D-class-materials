data types by comparision:
categorical not compariable: colors, symbols
ordered caompariable but no quantifiable difference: size
numercial: caompariable with quantifiables difference

data types by content:
sets, time, tree and networks, geographical, text

visual variables:
visual marks, visual attributes (size shape color/hue)

statistical graphs (structured data)
more complex visualizations (semi/un-structured data):
networks, tree, time series, geographical, text

data and visualization:
structured data: item, attributes, cell (1D, 2D, Multidimensional, e.g. many columns)
1D 
- table with 1 columns (x, y) (line charts/trends, histograms/distribution)
univariate distribution (e.g. uniform, normal, bi-modal, exponential)

Multivarable data
- regressionplot with marks (3D), scatterplot with color (3D), scatterplot matrix,
parallel coordinates plot (it clearly shows correlations of dimensions)

semi-structured data: 
networks
- node, link, path (directional), cluster, star (chunk), hub
- matrix (row, col - defines nodes; coordinates defines link; mark and hue - defines link length)

trees
tree hierarcical data,
treemap hierarcical - devided area

time series
gantt charts, stream graph, temporal heatmap (date data, e.g. gitcommit), scatterplot with animation (small multiples),
connected scatter plot (x, y, time series - connected dots)

geographical
point plot (with color), optimization -> distortion, traces (with time)

unstructed data:
text
text clouds (frequency of words -: scale of text hard to be precise)
text heatmap
sparklines(mini graph embeded in text)
